03/01/2016 - #2: Dynamic find_by Methods
  - performing a find of a task model where false
  - find_by method - search by tasks specifically
  - This is a really useful way to do a Find in Rail as there's a Taskmodel that searches for tasks that havenâ€™t been completed (i.e. the complete column is false). find_by_all is a concise way to achieve this

  - Theres no need to pass foreign keys in find conditions, just do the find through a has_many association.
  - can perform a 'find' through an association

05/01/2016 - #4: Move Find into Model
  - Moving a find into the model cleans up controllers and removes duplication
  - Can call custom find methods through association
  - Rails allows class methods through associations, which is very powerful
