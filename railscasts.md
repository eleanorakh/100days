02/01/2016 - #1: Caching with Instance Variables
- method called several times per request and each time sends a query to the database
- solve this by caching the result of the database call in an instance Variable

03/01/2016 - #2: Dynamic find_by Methods
  - performing a find of a task model where false
  - find_by method - search by tasks specifically
  - This is a really useful way to do a Find in Rail as there's a Taskmodel that searches for tasks that havenâ€™t been completed (i.e. the complete column is false). find_by_all is a concise way to achieve this

04/01/2016 - #3: Find through Association.
  - Theres no need to pass foreign keys in find conditions, just do the find through a has_many association.
  - can perform a 'find' through an association

05/01/2016 - #4: Move Find into Model
  - Moving a find into the model cleans up controllers and removes duplication
  - Can call custom find methods through association
  - Rails allows class methods through associations, which is very powerful

06/01/2016 - #5: Using with_scope
  - In this example there is a Task Model with a custom find method for all incomplete tasks, which is limiting.
  - But can't add conditions onto custom methods
  - with_scope defines the scope of the search/find
  - As he says in the screencast, any find executed in the new with_scope block automatically inherits the specified options (which you would have set)
